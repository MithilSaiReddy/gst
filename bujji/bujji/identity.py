bujji/identity.py
Identity layer — loads the four core Markdown files that define who bujji is
and who it's talking to. Files live in workspace/ and are loaded in priority order:

    SOUL.md      Values, principles, refusals. The ethical core. You write this.
    IDENTITY.md  Name, personality, tone, quirks. You write this.
    USER.md      Who the user is — projects, prefs, context. Agent updates this.
    AGENT.md     What tools/skills are active. Agent can update this.

Philosophy: plain Markdown, human-readable, editable in any text editor.
No JSON schemas. No embeddings. Just files.

To customise bujji: open any of these files and edit them freely.
To reset: delete the file — a fresh default will be created on next run.

- Be helpful, honest, and concise.
- Prefer action over lengthy explanation.
- Never fabricate facts — say "I don't know" rather than guess.
- Respect the user's privacy and autonomy.
- Always complete the task before summarising.
- When something is worth remembering, update USER.md without being asked.
